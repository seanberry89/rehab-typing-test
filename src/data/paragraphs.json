      "excerpt": "He had only just had a sip — in the corner, while the four dwarves sat round the table, and talked about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins, and depredations of dragons, and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they sounded much too adventurous — when, ding-dong-a-ling-dang, his bell rang again, as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off."

      "excerpt": "The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shriveled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice.  A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin.  He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas."

      "excerpt": "There was nothing of high mark in this.  They were not a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker's.  But they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last."

      "excerpt": "Again after a hundred years Glaurung, the first of the Uruloki, the fire-drakes of the North, issued from Angband's gates by night.  He was yet young and scarce half-grown, for long and slow is the life of the dragons, but the Elves fled before him to Ered Wethrin and Dorthonion in dismay; and he defiled the fields of Ard-galen.  Then Fingon prince of Hithlum rode against him with archers on horseback, and hemmed him round with a ring of swift riders; and Glaurung could not endure their darts, being not yet come to his full armory, and he fled back to Angband, and came not forth again for many years.  Fingon won great praise, and the Noldor rejoiced; for few foresaw the full meaning and threat of this new thing."

      "excerpt": "For who of the living has descended into the pits of Utumno, or has explored the darkness of the counsels of Melkor?  Yet this is held true by the wise of Eressea, that all those of the Quendi who came into the hands of Melkor, ere Utumno was broken, were put there in prison, and by slow arts of cruelty were corrupted and enslaved; and thus did Melkor breed the hideous race of the Orcs in envy and mockery of the Elves, of whom they were afterwards the bitterest of foes.  For the Orcs had life and multiplied after the manner of the Children of Iluvatar; and naught that had life of its own, nor the semblance of life, could ever Melkor make since his rebellion in the Ainulindale before the Beginning: so say the wise."

      "excerpt": "Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures.  During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he'd christened \"Fluffy.\""

      "excerpt": "Four summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered Mr. Ollivander's shop with Hagrid to buy a wand.  Mr. Ollivander had taken his measurements and then started handing him wands to try.  Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at last he had found the one that suited him — this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix.  Mr. Ollivander had been very surprised that Harry had been so compatible with this wand.  \"Curious,\" he had said, \"curious,\" and not until Harry asked what was curious had Mr. Ollivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry's wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the cord of Lord Voldemort's."

      "excerpt": "Now Fingolfin, King of the North, and High King of the Noldor, seeing that his people were become numerous and strong, and that the Men allied to them were many and valiant, pondered once more an assault upon Angband; for he knew that they lived in danger while the circle of the siege was incomplete, and Morgoth was free to labour in his deep mines, devising what evils none could foretell ere he should reveal them.  This counsel was wise according to the measure of his knowledge; for the Noldor did not yet comprehend the fullness of the power of Morgoth, nor understand that their unaided war upon him was without final hope, whether they hasted or delayed.  But because the land was fair and their kingdoms wide, most of the Noldor were content with things as they were, trusting them to last, and slow to begin an assault in which many must surely perish were it in victory or in defeat."

      "excerpt":"\"Hi Nob!\" he shouted.\"Where are you, you woolly-footed slowcoach? Nob!\"\n\"Coming, sir! Coming!\" A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out of a door, and seeing the travellers, stopped short and stared at them with great interest. \n\"Where's Bob?\" asked the landlord. \"You don't know?  Well find him!  Double sharp!  I haven't got six legs, nor six eyes neither!  Tell Bob there's five ponies that have to be stabled.  He must find room somehow.\" Nob trotted off with a grin and a wink.\n\"Well, now, what was I going to say?\" said Mr. Butterbur, tapping his forehead.  \"One thing drives out another, so to speak.  I'm that busy tonight, my head is going round.  There's a party that came up the Greenway from down South last night — and that was strange enough to begin with.  Then there's a traveling company of dwarves going West come in this evening.  And now there's you.  If you weren't hobbits, I doubt if we could house you.  But we've got a room or two in the north wing that were made special for hobbits, when this place was built.  On the ground floor as they usually prefer; round windows and all as they like it.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  You'll be wanting supper, I don't doubt.  As soon as may be.  This way now!\""
