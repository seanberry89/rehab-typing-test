// split() splits a string into an array of substrings, which uses the delimiter as the parameter to divide each string (from sting to array)

// or, supposedly, spread operator [...blank] of a string inside an array via spread operator, can split a string into substrings inside an array

// split("").forEach((character) => {}) returns each character from the substring, which would be useful if I was returning a new component..

// join() joins substrings from an array into a single string, which uses the delimiter as the parameter to combine each string (from array to string)

// charAt() returns the character from a string based on the specified index as the parameter: 0, 1, length - 1, or other


// Option 1:
// sx={{ color: { correct ? "red" : "blue" } }};

// Option 2:
// create a child component that returns a span with the paragraph data for each letter, which then I would use className for correct and incorrect letters

// Paper -- 1000px width + 200px height

{/* { use if/else operator to color the letters } */}
{/* Example: { correctLetters.includes(letter) ? letter : ' ' } */}
